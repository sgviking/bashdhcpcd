   DHCPDISCOVER -  Client broadcast to locate available servers.

   DHCPOFFER    -  Server to client in response to DHCPDISCOVER with
                   offer of configuration parameters.

   DHCPREQUEST  -  Client message to servers either (a) requesting
                   offered parameters from one server and implicitly
                   declining offers from all others, (b) confirming
                   correctness of previously allocated address after,
                   e.g., system reboot, or (c) extending the lease on a
                   particular network address.

   DHCPACK      -  Server to client with configuration parameters,
                   including committed network address.

   DHCPNAK      -  Server to client indicating client's notion of network
                   address is incorrect (e.g., client has moved to new
                   subnet) or client's lease as expired

   DHCPDECLINE  -  Client to server indicating network address is already
                   in use.

   DHCPRELEASE  -  Client to server relinquishing network address and
                   cancelling remaining lease.

   DHCPINFORM   -  Client to server, asking only for local configuration
                   parameters; client already has externally configured
                   network address.

4.3.5 DHCPINFORM message

   The server responds to a DHCPINFORM message by sending a DHCPACK
   message directly to the address given in the 'ciaddr' field of the
   DHCPINFORM message.  The server MUST NOT send a lease expiration time
   to the client and SHOULD NOT fill in 'yiaddr'.  The server includes
   other parameters in the DHCPACK message as defined in section 4.3.1.

DHCPREQUEST generated during INIT-REBOOT state:

      'server identifier' MUST NOT be filled in, 'requested IP address'
      option MUST be filled in with client's notion of its previously
      assigned address. 'ciaddr' MUST be zero. The client is seeking to
      verify a previously allocated, cached configuration. Server SHOULD
      send a DHCPNAK message to the client if the 'requested IP address'
      is incorrect, or is on the wrong network.

      Determining whether a client in the INIT-REBOOT state is on the
      correct network is done by examining the contents of 'giaddr', the
      'requested IP address' option, and a database lookup. If the DHCP
      server detects that the client is on the wrong net (i.e., the
      result of applying the local subnet mask or remote subnet mask (if
      'giaddr' is not zero) to 'requested IP address' option value
      doesn't match reality), then the server SHOULD send a DHCPNAK
      message to the client.

      If the network is correct, then the DHCP server should check if
      the client's notion of its IP address is correct. If not, then the
      server SHOULD send a DHCPNAK message to the client. If the DHCP
      server has no record of this client, then it MUST remain silent,
      and MAY output a warning to the network administrator. This
      behavior is necessary for peaceful coexistence of non-
      communicating DHCP servers on the same wire.

      If 'giaddr' is 0x0 in the DHCPREQUEST message, the client is on
      the same subnet as the server.  The server MUST broadcast the
      DHCPNAK message to the 0xffffffff broadcast address because the
      client may not have a correct network address or subnet mask, and
      the client may not be answering ARP requests.

      If 'giaddr' is set in the DHCPREQUEST message, the client is on a
      different subnet.  The server MUST set the broadcast bit in the
      DHCPNAK, so that the relay agent will broadcast the DHCPNAK to the
      client, because the client may not have a correct network address
      or subnet mask, and the client may not be answering ARP requests.
